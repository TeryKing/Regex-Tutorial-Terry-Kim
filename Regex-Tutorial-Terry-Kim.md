regular expressions can be used to find a specific pattern of characters within the string.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The anchors are components to start and end a string. 

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are components that communicate with the regex engine and must match the quantity of the characters of the expression going to the left.
There are two types of quantifiers: Greedy and Lazy



### OR Operator

The OR operator is a boolean that matches with either the left or the right of the expression.

### Character Classes

Character classes are just ways to match a specific amount of set characters.

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries
